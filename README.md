## Abstract
We use an up to date compilation of Tully-Fisher data to search for transitions in the evolution of the Tully-Fisher relation. Using a recently published data compilation, we find hints at $\approx 3\sigma$ level for a transition at a critical distance $D_c \simeq 17 Mpc$. The zero point (intercept)  amplitude of the transition is $\Delta \log A_B \simeq 0.2 \pm 0.06$ while the slope remains practically unchanged. If the transition is interpreted as due to a gravitational strength transition, it would imply a shift of the effective gravitational constant to lower values for distances larger than $D_c\simeq 17 Mpc$ by $\frac{\Delta G}{G}=-0.1 \pm 0.03$. Such a shift is of the anticipated  sign and magnitude but at somewhat lower distance (redshift) than the gravitational transition recently proposed to address the Hubble and growth tensions ($\frac{\Delta G}{G}\simeq -0.1$ at transition redshift  $z_t\lesssim 0.01$ ($D_c\lesssim 40 Mpc$)).
